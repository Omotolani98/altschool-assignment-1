            <h2><strong>Why I joined AltSchool</strong></h2>
            <p>
                For the longest time I have been thinking with computers, from hardware to
                software; I have always been intrigued by how computers worked. I got some technical classes
                for Computer Engineering, Programming. I stumbled upon cloud platform AWS and saw how easy it is
                to access different type of OS and resources just from the click of a button, I was hooked. I was searching online
                to look for what schools to attend to gain this knowledge, that's how I discovered AltSchool.
    
                I want to build, architect and manage solutions for Companies not just in one country but Multinational.
                Eventually I will build a solution managed for my own company some day.
